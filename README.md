# Trip Application

Travel app for past trips. I’ve always loved going on trips and reminiscing about them afterward. Sometimes you forget about aspects of the trip and are fuzzy about the things you did while away. My travel app will keep all of those thoughts and info, about the trip, in one place. You can list all the people you were with and your thoughts and rating of it. Other users you tag in your post will also see info about the trip so they can reminisce as well.
